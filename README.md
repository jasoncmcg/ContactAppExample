# ContactAppExample
Example Contact DB, API, App and RMarkdown Report to show all the pieces fitting together

Note: Once complete, this project will show a small working example of how to put together a small web application with all the parts fitting together.

## DB

To start with, the database will be in MSSQL. I plan to add a pgSQL variation and possibly a mySQL option.

## API

The API will be in Node's Express.js. I may possibly add a PHP variation later on.

## APP

The app itself will be in a custom client-side MVC HTML framework that draws inspiration from Angular. It will have the following components.

 - Services that talk to the APIs
 - Data files that talk to the Services (Model)
 - Page files that render the data (Controller)
 - HTML files that supply the page content(View)
 - The main structure with utilities, libraries and processes to handle the main operation
